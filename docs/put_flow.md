# Workflow for putting data to Vault Network
Client send a put request to network which will be handled by its correspondent ClientManager first.
The ClientManager will check whether such put request is allowed.
If allowed, the correspondent Primary, Backup and Sacrificial copy of such data will be passed to DataManagers.
DMs will pickup PmidNode to store the data and pmid_node's PmidManagers will be notified first.
PmidManagers updates account info of pmid_node and pass the put request further to it.
When PmidNode doesn't have enough space to store the copy, it will try to remove the Sacrificial it holds to free up some space if the incoming copy is Primary.
For each removed Sacrificial copy, a PutFailure will be sent out from PmidNode to PmidManager then to DataManager to ensure each persona get proper informed.


###Put(D)
_Client_   =>> |__ClientManager__ (Primary, Backup, Sacrificial)[Allow ? So : PutFailure]
          *->> |__DataManager__  [Exist(D) ? Terminate_Flow : {AddPmid.Sy, So}]
          *->> |__PmidManager__ {Put.Sy, So}
          *->  |_PmidNode_ [Store ? Flow_Completed : Primary? TryToRemoveSacrificial : PutFailure]

Note : with the current routing API design, the put request of Backup and Sacrificial copies will be sent using the same put request as Primary.
However, the DestinationAddress will be used to differentiate the different type of copy.
i.e. requiring a hash verification process in DataManager and PmidNode to replace the data_name
